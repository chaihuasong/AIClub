# Overview

Welcome to the 🤗 Datasets tutorials! These beginner-friendly tutorials will guide you through the fundamentals of working with 🤗 Datasets. You’ll load and prepare a dataset for training with your machine learning framework of choice. Along the way, you’ll learn how to load different dataset configurations and splits, interact with and see what’s inside your dataset, preprocess, and share a dataset to the Hub.

The tutorials assume some basic knowledge of Python and a machine learning framework like PyTorch or TensorFlow. If you’re already familiar with these, feel free to check out the quickstart to see what you can do with 🤗 Datasets.

The tutorials only cover the basic skills you need to use 🤗 Datasets. There are many other useful functionalities and applications that aren’t discussed here. If you’re interested in learning more, take a look at Chapter 5 of the Hugging Face course.
